## üîç Data Cleaning & Processing  

Before building the dashboard, the dataset underwent **data cleaning** and **preprocessing** to ensure accuracy and consistency. The steps included:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Handling Missing Values**  
- Identified missing values in key columns (e.g., salary, job role, satisfaction score).  
- Used **mean/median imputation** for numerical fields like salary and job satisfaction.  
- Used **mode imputation** for categorical values such as job roles.  

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Removing Duplicates**  
- Checked for duplicate employee records using `Employee ID`.  
- Removed duplicate entries to ensure accuracy.  

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Data Type Corrections**  
- Converted categorical variables like `Job Role` and `Education Level` into appropriate formats.  
- Standardized `Salary` data to ensure consistency in units (e.g., thousands).  

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Outlier Detection & Removal**  
- Used **IQR (Interquartile Range) Method** to detect anomalies in age and salary data.  
- Removed extreme outliers that could skew the analysis.  

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Feature Engineering**  
- Created **age groups** (e.g., 18-25, 26-35, etc.) for better visual representation.  
- Categorized salaries into brackets (`<5K`, `5K-10K`, etc.).  
- Transformed job satisfaction ratings into meaningful insights.  

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ **Data Normalization**  
- Standardized numerical columns to prevent bias in visual representation.  
- Used **Min-Max Scaling** for salary and experience levels.
